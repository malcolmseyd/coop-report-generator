% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
The introduction identifies the subject of the report and states its purpose, significance or objectives. For example, the subject could be the solution to a particular problem, the development, maintenance or testing of some software, the testing of some hypothesis or the analysis of some procedure. In the case of an extended work term, the relevance of this report to previous or similar work should be discussed. Limitations of the report, such as aspects that will not be described, should be included. The introduction should also briefly describe the company or organization where the work was done, and should include a summary of the organizational structure of the remainder of the report. Introductions should never be longer than the discussion. If a significant amount of background information is required, some of the material should be included as an appendix.
